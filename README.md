# Chip-8-Interpreter
Simple Chip-8 virtual machine interpreter/emulator  
Works in console based on commands  
First load your ROM file by command LoadRom "filename" - note that i check only  
if file exist, so try to load only c8 programs otherwise you will crash.  
Then you can specify your Clock rate by E.g SetClockRate 1000.  
NOTE that default clock rate is 600 which is good for probably  
70% of c8 ROMs you can fin. Then you can specify your color scheme only 2 schemes available tbh  
do it by FalloutMode [on/off] off is default - black and white on is grey and green.

for help in finding 2 pesky hard to track bugs.  


Maybe i will add super chip support in the future :).  
For now enjoy fotorealistic Chip-8 games!
